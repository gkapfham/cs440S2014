\MYTITLE{Laboratory Assignment Two: Implementing and Using a File System Traversal Tool}
\MYHEADERS{Laboratory Assignment Two}{Due: February 10, 2014}

\section*{Introduction}

  % Practicing software engineers normally use a version control system to manage most of the artifacts produced during the
  % phases of the software development life cycle.  In this course, we will always use the Git distributed version control
  % system to manage the files associated with our laboratory assignments.  In this laboratory assignment, you will learn
  % how to use the Bitbucket service for managing Git repositories and the {\tt git} command-line tool in the Ubuntu Linux
  % operating system.

\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

  This assignment invites you to submit printed and signed versions of the following deliverables: 

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item 
  \end{enumerate}

  It is recognized that not all of the students in the class may be familiar with the Git version control system and thus have some
  difficulty using and configuring the git plugin for Zsh.  Students who do not have access to a Git repository should see the
  instructor so that one can be made available to them for the purposes of completing this assignment. However, please note that you
  are not required to extensively use a Git repository to complete this assignment. Finally, students are strongly encouraged to
  write their laboratory report in \LaTeX.

  In adherence to the honor code, students should complete this assignment on an individual basis. While it is appropriate for
  students in this class to have high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the
  student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces assignments that are identical
  to, or merely variations on, someone else's work.  As such, deliverables that are nearly identical to the work of others will be
  taken as evidence of violating the \mbox{Honor Code}.
