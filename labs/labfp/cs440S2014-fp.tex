In adherence to the honor code, students should complete this assignment while only collaborating with those students
who are a part of their assigned team. While it is appropriate for students in this class to have high-level
conversations about the assignment with non-team members, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the team that
discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the team that produces an assignment that is identical to,
or merely variations on, the work on someone not on the team.  As such, deliverables that are nearly identical to the
work of others will be taken as evidence of violating the \mbox{Honor Code}.
