\MYTITLE{Laboratory Assignment Three: Using a Multi-Threaded Producer-Consumer Model}
\MYHEADERS{Laboratory Assignment Three}{Due: February 17, 2014}

\section*{Introduction}

Processes and threads are commonly used by the operating system itself and by the programs that run on the operating system.  In
this laboratory assignment, you will download, use, extend, and experiment with a multi-threaded producer-consumer model.  The
producer-consumer model, sometimes known as a bounded-buffer model, illustrates non-deterministic execution of threads that
share a common, fixed-size buffer.  In this assignment, you will download and use a working version of this model.  Then, you will
add some features to the model that enable you to experiment with it more effectively.  Finally, you will systematically break
various parts of the model in order to observe what can go wrong when implementing multi-threaded Java programs.

\section*{Accessing the Producer-Consumer Model}

During this laboratory assignment, and some subsequent assignments, we will securely communicate with the Bitbucket.org servers
that host the source code for our assignment. Students who are already comfortable with using Git and Bitbucket may skip the
majority of these steps and simply ask the instructor to share the course repository with them.  For those students who are not
yet using Git and Bitbucket, this laboratory assignment will teach you all of the steps needed to configure the accounts on the
departmental servers and the Bitbucket service.  Throughout the assignment, you should refer to the following Web site for
additional information about the use of Git and Bitbucket: \url{https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Bitbucket+101}.  

\begin{enumerate}
	
  \item If you have never done so before, you must use the {\tt ssh-keygen} program to create secure-shell keys that you
    can use to support your communication with the Bitbucket servers.  Type {\tt man ssh-keygen} and talk with the
    instructor to learn more about how to use this program.  What files does {\tt ssh-keygen} produce?  Where
    does this program store these files?

  \item If you do not already have a Bitbucket account, please go to the Bitbucket Web site and create one --- 
    make sure that you use your {\tt allegheny.edu} email address so that you can create an unlimited number of free
    Bitbucket repositories. Then, upload your ssh key to Bitbucket.

  \item Now, you need to test to see if you can authenticate with the Bitbucket servers.  First, show the course instructor that
    you have correctly configured your Bitbucket account.  Now, ask the instructor to share the course's Git repository with you.
    Open a terminal window on your workstation and change into the directory where you will store your files for this course.  For
    instance, you might have made a {\tt cs440S2014/} directory that will contain the Git repository that I will always use to
    share files with you.  Once you have done so, and only after I have shared the Git repository with you, please type the
    following command: {\tt git clone git@bitbucket.org:gkapfham/cs440s2014-share.git}.  If everything worked correctly, you
    should be able to download all of the files that you will need to use for this laboratory assignment. Please resolve any
    problems that you encountered by first reviewing the Bitbucket documentation and then discussing the challenges with the Git
    experts in this class. If you are still not able to run the {\tt git clone} command, then please see the instructor.

  \item Using your terminal window, you should browse the files that are in this Git repository.  In particular, please look in
    the {\tt labs/lab3/src/} directory and use Vim to study the Java programs that you find. What files are used to implement the
    producer-consumer model?

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Understanding and Extending the Producer-Consumer Model}

After you have carefully studied the source code of the Producer-Consumer model, you can compile and execute it.  What type of
output does this program produce?  Will this program halt?  If yes, then how long will it take to halt?  If no, then why does it
not halt? Finally, you should use the {\tt /usr/bin/time} program to time how long it takes to run the Producer-Consumer.

In order to better understanding how this program works, you should run it and then use the {\tt ps -eLf} and {\tt ps aux}
commands to track what Java processes are started when the model executes. You can also use the {\tt gnome-system-monitor} to
learn more about this program's behavior (to run this program you can type {\tt monitor} in the Unity dash).  To the best of your
ability, you should use these three programs --- and any others that you deem to be useful and relevant --- to better understand
how the ProducerConsumerModel creates processes and/or threads.

\begin{sloppypar}
  As you will see from studying the source code, the current implementation of the {\tt ProducerConsumerModel} has several
  hard-coded variables that control its behavior. Leveraging the JCommander system that you learned how to use in a previous
  laboratory assignment, you should now implement a command-line interface for the {\tt ProducerConsumerModel}.  This interface
  should make it possible to specify whether or not debugging output must be produced, the number of data items that must be
  produced and consumed, and the total number of consumers.  Details about the command-line arguments are provided in the comments
  of the {\tt ProducerConsumerModel.java} file. 
\end{sloppypar}

\section*{Understanding Defects in Multi-Threaded Programs}

  After you have finished writing the source code to support the command-line arguments for the {\tt ProducerConsumerModel}, you
  can take steps to systematically explore what happens if you make mistakes when implementing multi-threaded Java programs.
  Please ensure that you carefully make the following changes, recompile the program, execute the program, record the incorrect
  program output, and comment on why the output is evident.  Once you are done making the required defective implementations of
  the program, please return the modified code to the correct state!

\begin{enumerate}

  \item For the {\tt get} and {\tt put} methods inside of the {\tt CubbyHole}, systematically add a new method signature that does
    not declare the method to be {\tt synchronized}.  That is, you should first run the {\tt ProducerConsumerModel} with just the
    incorrect {\tt get}, then with just the incorrect {\tt put}, and finally with both the wrong {\tt get} and {\tt put}.   What
    does the output of the defective {\tt ProducerConsumerModel} look like?  How can you explain this output?  

  \item Now, keep the version of the {\tt get} and {\tt put} methods that do not use the {\tt synchronized} keyword and
    separately comment out the {\tt while} loop in both of the {\tt get} and {\tt put} methods.  Finally, you should separately
    comment out the call to the {\tt notifyAll} method at the end of both of these methods. What does the output of each of these
    {\tt ProducerConsumerModel}s look like? Can you explain why these defects produce the output that they do?

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Experimental Study of Performance}

  Now, you should use the correct implementation of the {\tt ProducerConsumerModel} to conduct an experiment.  You should
  measure the time overhead that is required to consume 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 different data items for three different numbers
  of consumers.  For example, you might use two, four, and eight different consumer threads for all of the different number of
  data items.  You should conduct each individual experiment at least five times in order to facilitate the calculation of
  arithmetic means.  After making sure that your timings do not include the cost associated with performing console output, you
  should collect execution timings of the {\tt ProducerConsumerModel}.  

  In preparation for writing your report, you may calculate arithmetic means by implementing your own Java program or by using the
  R language for statistical computing.  Moreover, your report should explain your experimental goals and design by clearly
  describing the commands that you type and the order in which they were typed.  You report should also include tables of results
  that furnish the running times for each of the different {\tt ProducerConsumerModel} configurations.  
  
\section*{Summary of the Required Deliverables}

This assignment invites you to submit printed and signed versions of the following deliverables: 

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item A paragraph that explains how multi-threaded Java programs use {\tt synchronized} 
    \item A detailed discussion of the execution behavior of a multi-threaded Java program
    \item A comprehensive analysis of the output of each defective multi-threaded Java program
    \item The report from an experimental study that characterizes the performance of the model 
  \end{enumerate}

Students are strongly encouraged to write their laboratory report in \LaTeX~and use tools such as the R language for statistical
computation to better analyze and visualize the empirical results. Please see the instructor if you have questions about the
requirements for these deliverables.

In adherence to the honor code, students should complete this assignment on an individual basis. While it is appropriate for
students in this class to have high-level conversations about the assignment, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the
student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others and the student who produces assignments that are identical
to, or merely variations on, someone else's work.  As such, deliverables that are nearly identical to the work of others will be
taken as evidence of violating the \mbox{Honor Code}.
